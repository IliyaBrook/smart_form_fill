# Privacy Policy for Smart Form Fill Chrome Extension

**Last updated:** Merch 14, 2024

This privacy policy describes how the "Smart Form Fill" Chrome extension `the Extension` collects, uses, and protects your personal information. The Extension is designed to help you automatically fill web forms.

## 1. Information We Collect

The Extension stores information that you *explicitly* choose to save within form profiles. This information is *entirely* user-provided and may include, but is not limited to:

*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** This may include your name, address, email address, phone number, and other information you choose to include in your profiles.
*   **Form Field Data:** The extension does *not* automatically collect a list of websites you visit. However, the extension analyzes the current website URL to match any saved form-filling rules you might have configured.

## 2. How We Collect Information

All information stored by the Extension is provided directly by you when you create or edit form profiles within the Extension's interface. The Extension does *not* automatically collect any data from websites you visit, other than the current URL for rule matching (as described above).

## 3. How We Use Information

The information you provide is used *solely* for the purpose of automatically filling web forms when you instruct the Extension to do so (e.g., by clicking the "Fill Form" button or selecting a profile). The Extension does not use this information for any other purpose. Specifically, we do *not*:

*   Use your data for advertising.
*   Analyze your data for trends or patterns.
*   Use your data for any purpose other than populating form fields.

## 4. How We Store Information

Your profile data is stored *locally* on your computer using the Chrome `storage.local` API. This data is *not* transmitted to any external servers or services.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do *not* share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties.

## 6. Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

*   **Access:** You can view all stored profile data within the Extension's interface.
*   **Modification:** You can edit or update your profile data at any time.
*   **Deletion:** You can delete individual profiles or all stored data at any time through the Extension's settings. Deleting a profile permanently removes its data from your computer.
